#include <stdio.h>

/*
    Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any order) and then
    displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows, columns,
    and diagonals:
    Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
    16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

    16  3  2 13
     5 10 11  8
     9  6  7 12
     4 15 14  1
    Row sums: 34 34 34 34
    Column sums: 34 34 34 34
    Diagonal sums: 34 34
    If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this example), the
    numbers are said to form a magic square. The magic square shown here appears in a 1514
    engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht DÃ¼rer. (Note that the middle numbers in the
    last row give the date of the engraving.)
